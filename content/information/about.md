This is an open source project based in Node.js and the Electron.js framework 
for using Wikipedia (English, text only, ~5,000,000 articles) on a Raspberry 
Pi to build a low-cost, Internet-free, education resource alternative.

Wiki Pi represents Wikipedia as a graph, takes articles as parameters and 
traverses them based on user-defined text similarity and relevance thresholds 
to aggregate related articles, and then uses natural language processing 
techniques to summarize this text and generate "course content".

Considering the low cost of Raspberry Pi's themselves (~$35), and how the 
entirety of Wikipedia could be loaded onto a USB, the primary goal of this 
project is to create an educational resource that could be distributed to 
disadvantaged schools around the world with little to no internet access.

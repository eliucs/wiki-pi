# Wiki Pi

This is an open source project based in Node.js for using the entirety of
Wikipedia (English, only text) on a Raspberry Pi to build a low cost,
internet-free, educational resource.

Wiki Pi represents Wikipedia as a graph, takes articles as parameters and
traverses them based on user-defined text similarity and relevance thresholds
to aggregate related articles, and uses machine learning and natural language
processing techniques to summarize this text and generate coherent
"course content" from this text.

Considering the low cost of Raspberry Pi's themselves, and how all of
Wikipedia could be loaded on a USB, the primary goal of this project
is to create an educational resource that could be distributed to impoverished
schools around the world with little to no internet access.

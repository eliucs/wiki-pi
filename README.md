# Wiki Pi

This is an open source project based in Node.js for using Wikipedia (English,
text only, ~200,000 most popular articles) on a Raspberry Pi to build a
low-cost, Internet-free educational resource.

Wiki Pi represents Wikipedia as a graph, takes articles as parameters and
traverses them based on user-defined text similarity and relevance thresholds
to aggregate related articles, and uses natural language processing techniques
to summarize this text and generate course content from this text.

Considering the low cost of Raspberry Pi's themselves, and how a large portion
of Wikipedia could be loaded on a USB, the primary goal of this project
is to create an educational resource that could be distributed to disadvantaged
schools around the world with little to no internet access.
